# How it works

![image](https://github.com/bamlab/flashlight/assets/4534323/b39f8578-13d8-4eda-9ce1-98293b087081)

[flashlight.dev](https://app.flashlight.dev) will run the [`flashlight test`](../test) command for you to run a [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) test on **real** a lower end device on AWS Device Farm.

## Device used

By default, Flashlight runs on a Samsung A15. See [our research](https://apps.theodo.com/article/what-is-the-performance-of-your-users-devices) on why we selected that device.
